How we worked on the project:
  We split the project into 5 parts with the first 4 being assigned to each member 
  of the group and the final part we all worked on together. Aubrey worked on command chaining, Hamilton
  worked on redirecting commands outputs to a file, Griff worked on pipelining and Jake worked on background
  execution. Finally we all worked together to implement the history command.
